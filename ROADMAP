Roadmap
=======

I've recently tagged 0.1.2 in the repo. Below are the various aspects I will be
looking to cover during this release and the coming 0.2 tag.

DAML 0.1 series
---------------

* Work out various speed enhancements
* Tackle all sorts of security issues
* Start using DAML live at the dasa.cc domain to uncover problems
* Refactor current code base to create Parser instances.
* Rewrite/refactor sandboxed evals to to maintain namespace specific to
  transformation at-hand while still being reasonably fast.
* Try to uncover any and all issues related to characters in source document
  that will cause the parser to error
* Debate whether or not to change attribute syntax to reflect css selector
  syntax more closely, specifically #header[attr=val][attr2=val2] or a
  variation of such.
* Possibly need to choose a new name? daml.org extends xml. This is a fuzzy
  line of sorts.
* Look at precompiling templates and prepping sandbox with template content
  that isn't dynamic (functions)

DAML 0.2 series
---------------

* Setup basic cherrypy Tool for getting cherrypy users easily started.
* bug test the hell out of everything

DAML 0.3 series
---------------

* Work on django integration and implementing various features django provides
  into DAML so that, if one chooses, they can use this instead of built-in
  django templates, while not losing functionality.
