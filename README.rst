Building From Source
=====================
dmsl depends on Cython >= 0.15 so install as per your distribution, for example::

  sudo easy_install cython

After satisfying lxml and cython dependencies, clone the repo from github, build and install globally with the following::

  git clone git://github.com/dasacc22/dmsl.git
  cd dmsl
  sudo python setup.py install

or if you wish to not install globally, you can build the C extensions in place
and use from directory::

  python setup.py build_ext -i

.. _unittests:

Running Unit Tests
==================
To run unit tests, build in place and execute test/ directory::

  python setup.py build_ext -i
  cd dmsl/
  python test/

Submitting Bugs
===============
Please submit bugs and feature requests to the github issue tracker.

Speed Tests
===========
Damsel is fast while keeping the codebase relatively small. Below are results
from the genshi svn benchmark bigtable.py for different template languages.

This test creates a table with 1000 rows, each containing 10 columns from calling
dict.values() and setting each as the column text. It's a silly test, but let's
look at how this can be handled in dmsl::

  %table for row in table:
      %tr for col in row.values():
          %td {col}

And the results::

  Damsel Template  37.22 ms
  Mako Template    21.64 ms
  Genshi Template  127.03 ms
  Django Template  274.57 ms

Features and Examples
=====================

Command Line Interface
----------------------
Damsel can run via command line. For python2.7::

  python -m dmsl -h  # see for more info

For python2.6::

  pip install argparse
  python -m dmsl.__main__ -h

Django Example
--------------
I'm not a django developer but I did run through a portion of the tutorial to
provide enough informationhere to get started.

Edit settings.py and add the following::

  import dmsl
  dmsl.set_template_dir('/path/to/dmsl/templates')

The following two samples are adapted from the polls example from django docs.
Edit views.py and render a response like this::

  from polls.models import Poll
  from django.http import HttpResponse
  import dmsl
  
  def index(request):
      latest_poll_list = Poll.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
      context = {'latest_poll_list': latest_poll_list}

      # there's two ways to render the template depending on if you're implement a caching mechanism
      # dmsl.Template returns an object you can store in memory for rendering later
      # Note the ** to expand the dict as keyword arguments.
      response = dmsl.Template('index.dmsl').render(**context)
      # optionally you could simply do the following which simply calls the above
      # response = dmsl.parse('index.dmsl', **context)
      return HttpResponse(response)

The following is the contents of index.dmsl::

  polls = kwargs.get('latest_poll_list', [])
  
  %html %body
      if not polls:
          %p No polls are available
  
      %ul for poll in polls:
          %li %a[href="/polls/{poll.id}/"] {poll.question}

Errors in a template will throw a RenderException. Insepct the "Exception Value:" on the django error page for the dmsl file
and line number listed next to it.

That should be enough to get a savvy django developer started. I'll get a more complete example done in the future.

Generic Source Example
----------------------
To use in source::

  import dmsl
  dmsl.set_template_dir('./templates')
  dmsl.Template('index.dmsl').render(**{'content': 'Hello World'})

Language Features
=================

Elements and Attributes
-----------------------
Damsel features html outlining similar to css selectors. The most notable difference is using a percent (%) to specify a regular tag::

  %html
      %body Hello World

Damsel is indention based, but works just fine with variable indention with a minimum of two spaces and as long as blocks align as intended::

  %html
    %body
          %p This works just fine

Tags can also be inlined if they are only wrappers::

  %html %body %ul
      %li %span Home
      %li %span Page

Classes and IDs can be specified the same as CSS. If no tag is specified, a DIV is created by default::

  %html %body
      #top %h1.title Hello World
      #content %p.text

Attributes are specified as in CSS. Breaking attributes across multiple lines is not yet implemented::

  %html %body
      %img[border=0][style="margin: 20px;"]
      %a#home.link[href="http://www.dasa.cc"]

Embedding Python
----------------
Damsel also supports embedding python in the document. There's no special syntax for use aside from embedding a function call inline of a tag, starting the call with a colon (:). HTML outlining and python can be intermixed for different effect. Embedding a variable within an outline element is done via the standard python string `Formatter <http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`_::
  
  n = 4
  greet = lambda x: 'Hello, '+x
  %html %body for x in range(n):
      y = x*2.5
      %p Number is {x}. :greet('Daniel'). Here's the number multiplied and formatted, {y:.2f}

str.format is also available but is not safe for formatting user input. In cases where you want to call this directly with safety checks, fmt is available in the sandbox::

  %html %body
      a = 'a'
      b = 'b'
      c = fmt('{0}{b}', a, b=b)
      %p {c}

Python can be used to control the flow of the document as well::

  val = False
  %html %body
      %p Test the value of val
      if val:
          %p val is True
      else:
          %p val is False

It's important to note how the document becomes aligned. Intermixed outline elements will be left-aligned to their nearest python counterpart. So above, %p val is False will be the resulting object, and will be properly aligned where the if statement is, placing it as a node of body.

The evaluation of python code takes place in a sandbox that can be extended with custom objects and functions. So for example, in your controller code::

  import pymongo.objectid
  import dmsl
  dmsl.extensions['ObjectId'] = pymongo.objectid.ObjectId

ObjectId will then be available for use in your dmsl templates.

Filters
-------
Another extensible feature of dmsl are filters. A filter allows you to write a slightly altered syntax for calling a python function. Take for example the builtin js filter used for specifying multiple javascript files in a particular location::

  def js(s, _locals):
      s = s.splitlines()
      n = s[0]
      s = s[1:]
      return ['%script[src={0}{1}][type="text/javascript"]'.format(n, x) for x in s]

In a dmsl template, this (as other filters) can be accessed like so::

  %html %head
      :js /js/lib/
          jquery.min.js
          jquery.defaultinput.js
          utils.js
          js.js

This would be the same as explicitly typing it out::

  %html %head
      %script[src="/js/lib/jquery.min.js"][type="text/javascript"]
      %script[src="/js/lib/jquery.defaultinput.js"][type="text/javascript"]
      %script[src="/js/lib/utils.js"][type="text/javascript"]
      %script[src="/js/lib/js.js"][type="text/javascript"]

Filters can be used for most anything from a docutils or markdown processor, automatic form generation based on keywords and variables, or to whatever you might imagine.

Reusable Templates
------------------
Being able to create templates are a must and there are two methods implemented in dmsl to do so. The first is the standard include statement. Consider the following file, top.dmsl::

  #top
      %h1 Hello World
      %p.desc This is a test.

This file can then be included into another, for example, overlay.dmsl::

  %html %body
      include('top.dmsl')
      #content
          %p One
          %p Two

The top.dmsl contents will be aligned appropriately based upon its location in overlay.dmsl. The second method for creating a proper template is the ability to extend a dmsl template. This is handled by a call to the extends function, and then specifying which portion of the template we want to extend. Specifying which portion to extend is based on the ID assigned to a tag. Take the overlay.dmsl example from above. There are two elements we can extend, #top and #content. We can either override the contents, or append new elements to them. Let's do this in index.dmsl::

  extends('overlay.dmsl')
  
  #top %h1 This will override all elements in top
  #content[super=]
      %p three

Here, we simply specify the the tag hash we want to access and then provide the nested content. If a super attribute is specified, this tells dmsl to append the content to the current element we're extending. This super attribute will **not** be a part of the final output. This method also forces strict conformance to a single ID per element, so if you're use to given multiple nodes the exact same ID, now is a good time to stop.

More examples coming soon, refer to test/templates for more.
