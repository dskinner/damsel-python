DAML
====

This project is a work in progress. Refer to test/templates/ for available syntax.

To run unit tests:
#> python test/

To parse a document from command line:
#> python daml.py my_template.daml daml # to get resulting string, uses hr_build
#> python daml.py my_template.daml hr # run primitive speed test on hr_build method
#> python daml.py my_template.daml r # run primitive speed test on relative_build method


Explanation of Syntax Choices
=============================

First note, I've never actually used HAML or ruby for that matter beyond
writing a quick ruby profiler (and having to google how to write every single
line of the ruby code...) and using an example doc from their site. Point being
I may very well and very easily mis-state some aspect of HAML.

While the basic syntax choice to represent tags is the same as HAML, there are
some significant differences from there on. Specifically, I have chosen
syntaxes that are either, (a) already familiar with python users, or (b) found
to my liking in the HAML syntax as specified by their documentation.

Specifically on point (b), I was unhappy with the variation of syntax in HAML
for doing different things. Such as applying text filters, calling ruby code,
and some other various bits. As I went over the documentation and started
making choices for how to implement these various pieces, one of the first
choices I made was to unify much of the syntax. For example, to call any piece
of python code, one simply uses the : directive. The : directive can also be
embedded in a line, but *only* for calling a function. So for example, you can
create blocks of python code as such

  :l = []
  :for x in range(10):
  :    l.append(x)

The variable l is accessible for use elsewhere in the document as well. In
addition to the example above, one can also write straight to the document
with a list comprehension.

  %ul
      :['%li {0}'.format(x) for x in l]

Note, the above is more of a side effect of implementation more so then a
planned feature. Everything is subject to change and still under heavy
development. Here is an example of defining a lambda function and embedding a
result somewhere

  :greet = lambda x: 'Hello, {0}'.format(x)

  %p :greet('John Doe'). Welcome to the site.

Also note you can define a regular function as well, for example:

  :def greet(x):
  :    return 'Hello, {0}'.format(x)

Now then, discussing part (a), the choice to follow python syntax for the
recent string.Formatter seemed like the most logical choice. Currently due to
speed issues, using the syntax is just that, and does not actually make use of
string.Formatter. The intention though is for it to use string.Formatter so one
can leverage a pre-existing knowledge of string formatting and make use of all
features available from the standard library.

Currently, the variable declaration syntax is limited until I work out some
speed issues I am having with string.Formatter but never-the-less, here are
some examples.

  :title = 'Hello World!'
  :user = 'John Doe'

  %h1 = {title}
  %p Welcome to the site, {user}. We hope you enjoy.

This works find at the moment, but eventually, you can expect to leverage
all that is string.Formatter and have it function essentially as you would ever
expect it to.

More to come..
